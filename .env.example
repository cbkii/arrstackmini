# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer a configuration source.
#
# The generated .env (default: ${ARR_STACK_DIR}/.env) is produced by
# ./arrstack.sh based on arrconf/userr.conf.defaults.sh combined with
# your overrides in ${ARR_BASE}/userr.conf (default: ${HOME}/srv/userr.conf).
#
# Edit ${ARR_BASE}/userr.conf to change settings, then rerun ./arrstack.sh.
# Do not edit this file or rely on it for defaults; it will be removed in a
# future release once downstream tooling has migrated.
