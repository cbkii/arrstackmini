## Overview
`arrstack.sh` assembles the following containers inside a Gluetun VPN namespace:

- Gluetun (Proton OpenVPN with native port forwarding)
- qBittorrent (Vuetorrent-compatible WebUI)
- port-sync (Alpine helper that keeps qBittorrent aligned with the forwarded port)
- Caddy (reverse proxy inside the Gluetun namespace that fronts every service on LAN ports 80/443)
- Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr
- FlareSolverr

Only the Caddy reverse proxy is published on the LAN (ports 80/443). Every application continues to run inside Gluetun‚Äôs network namespace so traffic egresses the VPN while health probes and helpers stay local.

## Stack highlights
- **Reproducible bootstrap** ‚Äì `arrstack.sh` verifies Docker Compose prerequisites, creates the directory tree, generates secrets, writes `.env`, and starts the stack non-interactively when `--yes` is supplied.
- **Opinionated defaults** ‚Äì all configuration inputs inherit from `arrconf/userconf.defaults.sh`, allowing simple overrides in `arrconf/userconf.sh` (ignored by Git) without editing the script.
- **Alias-driven operations** ‚Äì `.arraliases` exposes helper commands (`arr.up`, `arr.logs`, `arr.vpn.status`, `arr.help`, etc.) for routine management.
- **Unified reverse proxy** ‚Äì Caddy shares the Gluetun network namespace and is the only container publishing LAN ports (80/443). LAN clients bypass credentials while non-LAN clients authenticate via Basic Auth before reaching the apps.
- **Native port forwarding** ‚Äì OpenVPN Proton credentials are massaged into the `+pmp` form and Gluetun's `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND` immediately pushes the assigned port into qBittorrent's Web API. A lightweight `port-sync` container still polls the control server as a watchdog so qBittorrent stays aligned even after reconnects.

## Requirements
- 64-bit Debian Bookworm host with at least 4 CPU cores, 4 GB RAM, and fast storage for downloads.
- Example device: Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) running Debian Bookworm (64-bit) has been validated end-to-end.
- Docker Engine and Compose v2. The installer will `apt-get install docker.io docker-compose-plugin` if they are missing.
- Command-line dependencies available on the host: `curl`, `jq`, and `openssl`. Install them on Debian with `sudo apt-get install curl jq openssl`.
- ProtonVPN Plus or Unlimited subscription for port forwarding support.
- Proton VPN OpenVPN credentials stored in `arrconf/proton.auth` (`PROTON_USER`, `PROTON_PASS`).

## Quick start
1. **Create the default stack root (`~/srv`) and clone arrstack-mini.**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/srv
   cd ~/srv
   git clone https://github.com/cbkii/arrstackmini.git
   cd arrstackmini
   ```
2. **Add your ProtonVPN credentials.**
   ```bash
   cp arrconf/proton.auth.example arrconf/proton.auth
   nano arrconf/proton.auth
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your Proton VPN username and password (the installer tightens the file permissions automatically).
3. **(Optional) Adjust defaults before installation.** Copy `arrconf/userconf.sh.example` to `arrconf/userconf.sh` and tweak values such as `LAN_IP`, `SERVER_COUNTRIES`, `PVPN_ROTATE_COUNTRIES`, media directories, or host port overrides. Skip this if the defaults suit you‚Äîthe installer can be rerun whenever you want to apply changes.
4. **(Optional) Customize the port-sync helper image.**
   The default `alpine:3.20.3` boots fine and installs `curl` on the fly. If you prefer a pre-baked image (for example one built with `curl`/CA bundles already present), publish it to your registry of choice and set `PORT_SYNC_IMAGE=your/image:tag` in `arrconf/userconf.sh` (a minimal Dockerfile just needs `FROM alpine:3.20` plus `apk add --no-cache curl ca-certificates`).
5. **Run the installer.**
   ```bash
   ./arrstack.sh
   ```
   - Review the summary shown before containers launch and confirm to proceed.
   - `--yes` skips the confirmation prompt but is meant for scripted or repeat runs‚Äîleave it off on your first install.
   - Run `./arrstack.sh --help` for flags such as `--rotate-api-key`, `--rotate-caddy-auth`, and `--setup-host-dns` (automates the host DNS takeover helper).

    The script installs Docker Compose prerequisites when needed, creates the required directory tree under `${ARR_STACK_DIR}`, generates secrets (including `.env`), waits for Gluetun health/port forwarding, then launches the remaining containers. Any blockers surface as warnings when safe fallbacks exist, so first-time installs should still complete.

## Important notes

- ‚úÖ **Pinned container versions with validation** ‚Äì every service ships with a known-good tag. During startup the installer now validates each image and automatically falls back to LinuxServer's `:latest` tag when a pinned build disappears (the default for Prowlarr and Bazarr). Override tags in `.env`/`arrconf/userconf.sh` and review the [version management guide](docs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md) before upgrading.
- üÜò **Recovery helper** ‚Äì `${ARR_STACK_DIR}/scripts/fix-versions.sh` repairs `.env` if an old LinuxServer tag is removed. It creates a timestamped backup and replaces missing images with the safe fallback before rerunning the installer.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings over failures** ‚Äì the installer continues when it cannot detect a LAN IP or when default credentials remain. Read the summary at the end of the run and remediate highlighted risks.
- ü™™ **Helper aliases** ‚Äì a rendered `.arraliases` file lands in `${ARR_STACK_DIR}` and can be sourced for `arr.vpn.*`, `arr.help`, `arr.health`, and other shortcuts.
- ‚ö†Ô∏èüîê **Credentials** ‚Äì the installer captures the temporary qBittorrent password from container logs and stores it as `QBT_PASS` in `.env`. The Gluetun hook and port-sync authenticate with those credentials whenever the WebUI demands it, while Caddy allows LAN clients straight through and prompts non-LAN clients for the Basic Auth user recorded in `${ARR_DOCKER_DIR}/caddy/credentials`. That file (mode `0600`) contains the current username/password pair, while `.env` retains only the bcrypt hash.
- üõ°Ô∏è **LAN auth model** ‚Äì qBittorrent keeps `LocalHostAuth`, CSRF, clickjacking, and host-header protections enabled while the installer maintains a LAN whitelist so the WebUI mirrors Caddy‚Äôs ‚Äúno password on LAN‚Äù stance. Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and Bazarr retain their native logins by default; rely on Caddy‚Äôs `remote_ip` matcher for the LAN bypass unless you opt into per-app tweaks manually.
- üåê **LAN DNS & TLS** ‚Äì the optional `local_dns` service (enabled by default) runs dnsmasq on `${LAN_IP}`, answering for `*.${LAN_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` (`home.arpa` unless overridden). Point your router or client DNS to `${LAN_IP}` for automatic hostnames, or disable it with `ENABLE_LOCAL_DNS=0` and manage `/etc/hosts` yourself. Import the Caddy internal CA from `${ARR_DOCKER_DIR}/caddy/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt` (or swap in publicly trusted certificates) so browsers trust the default HTTPS endpoints.
  Debian Bookworm binds port 53 with `systemd-resolved` by default; pass `--setup-host-dns` to `arrstack.sh` to back up the current resolver state, disable the stub non-destructively, write a static `/etc/resolv.conf`, and restart the `local_dns` container automatically. You can rerun the helper later with `./scripts/host-dns-setup.sh` and undo the change any time with `./scripts/host-dns-rollback.sh`.
  1. Set your router‚Äôs DHCP DNS server to `${LAN_IP}` so new devices learn the resolver automatically.
  2. Override DNS manually on devices that allow it (laptops, consoles, smart TVs) if the router cannot be changed.
  3. On Android, leave Private DNS **Off** or **Automatic**‚Äîforcing a public resolver bypasses local hostnames.
  **Domain suffix note:** prefer `.home.arpa` (RFC 8375). `.lan` is supported but not reserved, so some clients may leak queries to the public internet.

### First-time checklist
After `./arrstack.sh` (or `./arrstack.sh --yes` when automating) finishes:

1. **Change the qBittorrent password.** Log in with the credentials stored in `.env` (`QBT_USER`/`QBT_PASS`), update them in Settings ‚Üí WebUI, then mirror the new values in `.env`.
2. **Rotate the Caddy Basic Auth credentials.** Run `./arrstack.sh --rotate-caddy-auth` (or set `FORCE_REGEN_CADDY_AUTH=1 ./arrstack.sh --yes`) to mint a fresh username/password pair. The plaintext is written to `${ARR_DOCKER_DIR}/caddy/credentials`, and the bcrypt hash is saved to `.env`. Prefer manual control? You can still generate a hash yourself with `docker run --rm caddy caddy hash-password --plaintext 'yourpass'` and update `.env` accordingly.
3. **Decide how LAN DNS resolves the stack.** Leave `ENABLE_LOCAL_DNS=1` and point routers/devices at `${LAN_IP}` so dnsmasq serves `*.${LAN_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` automatically, or disable it and create manual DNS/`/etc/hosts` entries that map each service (`qbittorrent.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}`, `sonarr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}`, etc.) to `LAN_IP`.
4. **Set a fixed `LAN_IP`.** Edit `arrconf/userconf.sh` if the summary warned about `0.0.0.0` exposure.
5. **Reload aliases.** `source ${ARR_STACK_DIR}/.arraliases` to gain `arr.vpn.status`, `arr.help`, `arr.logs`, and other useful aliased quick commands.
6. **Verify VPN status.** `docker logs gluetun --tail 100` should show a healthy tunnel and forwarded port.
7. **Review version guidance when upgrading.** Refer to [docs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md](docs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md) for image pinning strategy and manual upgrade steps.

## Configuration
### Directory layout
Defaults are defined in `arrconf/userconf.defaults.sh` and can be overridden in `arrconf/userconf.sh`.

| Purpose             | Default path |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Stack root          | `~/srv/arrstack` (`${ARR_BASE}/arrstack`)
| Docker volumes      | `${ARR_DOCKER_DIR}` (`${ARR_BASE}/docker-data` ‚Üí `~/srv/docker-data` by default)
| Proton auth/env     | `${ARRCONF_DIR}` (`<repo>/arrconf`)
| Downloads           | `${DOWNLOADS_DIR}` (`${HOME}/Downloads`)
| Completed downloads | `${COMPLETED_DIR}` (`${HOME}/Downloads/completed`)
| Media library       | `${MEDIA_DIR}` (`/media/mediasmb`)
| TV library          | `${TV_DIR}` (`/media/mediasmb/Shows`)
| Movies library      | `${MOVIES_DIR}` (`/media/mediasmb/Movies`)

Ensure to edit media and download directories before running, using paths with sufficient free storage space.

All secrets and config directories are created with restrictive permissions (`0600`/`0700`) when using the default permission profile.
To allow read-only collaboration, set `ARR_PERMISSION_PROFILE=collaborative` in `arrconf/userconf.sh`. This relaxes non-secret files to group-readable (`0640`) and data directories to `0750` while keeping secrets locked to `0600`.

### Environment variables
`arrstack.sh` writes `.env` during installation by reading `arrconf/userconf.defaults.sh` and applying any overrides from `arrconf/userconf.sh`. Beginners can copy `arrconf/userconf.sh.example`, adjust values, and rerun `./arrstack.sh` whenever they want the stack to pick up new settings.

The tables below summarise every configurable input exposed by `arrstack.sh` together with practical reasons to change them.

#### Paths and storage
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `ARR_BASE` | `~/srv` | Move the entire stack to a different root without editing every path individually. `ARR_STACK_DIR` and `ARR_DOCKER_DIR` inherit from this value. |
| `ARR_STACK_DIR` | `${ARR_BASE}/arrstack` | Relocate the generated `docker-compose.yml`, scripts, and `.arraliases`. Useful when storing the stack on another disk. |
| `ARR_ENV_FILE` | `${ARR_STACK_DIR}/.env` | Keep the generated `.env` in a separate secrets vault or version-controlled directory. |
| `ARR_DOCKER_DIR` | `${ARR_BASE}/docker-data` | Choose where Docker volumes live (e.g. move to a large external drive). |
| `ARRCONF_DIR` | `<repo>/arrconf` | Relocate Proton credentials and user config if you want them outside the repo tree. |
| `DOWNLOADS_DIR` | `~/Downloads` | Set the root for active qBittorrent downloads. |
| `COMPLETED_DIR` | `${DOWNLOADS_DIR}/completed` | Control where finished downloads are moved. |
| `MEDIA_DIR` | `/media/mediasmb` | Point to the base of your media library share. |
| `TV_DIR` | `${MEDIA_DIR}/Shows` | Tell Sonarr where your TV library lives. |
| `MOVIES_DIR` | `${MEDIA_DIR}/Movies` | Tell Radarr where your movie library lives. |

> Tip: The defaults already place the stack under `~/srv`, but you can set `ARR_BASE` to another path (for example `/mnt/fastdisk`) and the inherited values for `ARR_STACK_DIR` and `ARR_DOCKER_DIR` will follow automatically.

#### Identity and networking
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `PUID` | Current user ID (`id -u`) | Run containers as another user (e.g. a dedicated media account). |
| `PGID` | Current group ID (`id -g`) | Match the media group so containers can write to shared folders. |
| `TIMEZONE` | `Australia/Sydney` | Align container logs and cron tasks with your local timezone. |
| `LAN_IP` | Auto-detected (falls back to `0.0.0.0`) | Bind services to a specific RFC1918 address instead of all interfaces. |
| `LOCALHOST_IP` | `127.0.0.1` | Change where the Gluetun control API binds on the host (advanced). |
| `VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER` | `protonvpn` | Keep Gluetun pinned to ProtonVPN. Change only when migrating to a different supported provider. |
| `VPN_TYPE` | `openvpn` | Force Gluetun to use Proton's OpenVPN stack (required for port forwarding). |
| `SERVER_COUNTRIES` | `Switzerland,Iceland,Romania,Czech Republic,Netherlands` | Limit ProtonVPN exits to countries that support port forwarding or suit your latency. |
| `PVPN_ROTATE_COUNTRIES` | `Switzerland,Iceland,Romania,Czech Republic,Netherlands` | Optional ProtonVPN rotation list used by `arr.vpn switch`. Any extra countries you add are merged with `SERVER_COUNTRIES` automatically. |
| `GLUETUN_CONTROL_PORT` | `8000` | Adjust the host port for the Gluetun control API when 8000 is taken. |

#### Credentials and WebUI access
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `GLUETUN_API_KEY` | Generated on first run | Reuse an existing key when migrating installs. Leave blank to auto-generate. |
| `QBT_USER` | `admin` | Set your desired qBittorrent username before the first login. |
| `QBT_PASS` | `adminadmin` | Seed a temporary qBittorrent password (update in WebUI afterwards). |
| `QBT_DOCKER_MODS` | `ghcr.io/vuetorrent/vuetorrent-lsio-mod:latest` | Swap to a different qBittorrent WebUI mod or remove mods entirely. |
| `QBT_AUTH_WHITELIST` | `127.0.0.1/32,127.0.0.0/8,::1/128` | Allow extra CIDR ranges to bypass the qBittorrent login page (useful on trusted LANs). |

#### LAN DNS
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `LAN_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` | `home.arpa` | Choose a different private suffix (e.g. `lan`) for Caddy hostnames if your network already uses one. |
| `ENABLE_LOCAL_DNS` | `1` | Set to `0` to skip running the `local_dns` dnsmasq container and manage name resolution manually. |
| `UPSTREAM_DNS_1` | `1.1.1.1` | Point dnsmasq at your preferred upstream resolver (e.g. router, Pi-hole). |
| `UPSTREAM_DNS_2` | `1.0.0.1` | Secondary upstream resolver for redundancy. |

> **Note:** `.home.arpa` is reserved for private residential networks by [RFC 8375](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8375). You can still set `LAN_DOMAIN_SUFFIX=lan` for legacy behaviour, but it is not guaranteed to stay collision-free on public DNS.

#### Reverse proxy
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` | `home.arpa` | Controls the hostnames served by Caddy (`qbittorrent.<suffix>`, `sonarr.<suffix>`, etc.). Inherits from `LAN_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` when unset. |
| `CADDY_LAN_CIDRS` | `192.168.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12` | Expand or tighten which client IP ranges bypass Caddy Basic Auth. |
| `CADDY_BASIC_AUTH_USER` | `user` | Username presented to non-LAN clients when Caddy prompts for credentials. |
| `CADDY_BASIC_AUTH_HASH` | `$2b$12$ciwhuBgBxJQrQQuNieDrT.9n4keVPlYFO/uCK/Tfw/MSsRwKYSDfa` | Replace with your own bcrypt hash to secure remote Basic Auth access. |

#### Behaviour toggles
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `ARR_PERMISSION_PROFILE` | `strict` | Switch to `collaborative` to make non-secret files group-readable (`0640`/`0750`) when sharing the host with other users. |
| `ASSUME_YES` | `0` | Set to `1` for unattended installs that must skip prompts (avoid enabling on first run). |
| `FORCE_ROTATE_API_KEY` | `0` | Set to `1` to regenerate the Gluetun API key on the next run (useful if the key leaked). |

#### Container images
| Variable | Default | Why change it? |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `GLUETUN_IMAGE` | `qmcgaw/gluetun:v3.39.1` | Pin to a newer Gluetun tag after validating compatibility. |
| `QBITTORRENT_IMAGE` | `lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:5.1.2-r2-ls415` | Track a newer qBittorrent release. |
| `SONARR_IMAGE` | `lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:4.0.15.2941-ls291` | Upgrade/downgrade Sonarr carefully when required. |
| `RADARR_IMAGE` | `lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:5.27.5.10198-ls283` | Change Radarr tag once confirmed stable. |
| `PROWLARR_IMAGE` | `lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest` | Pin to a specific version to avoid unexpected updates. |
| `BAZARR_IMAGE` | `lscr.io/linuxserver/bazarr:latest` | Pin to a specific version to avoid unexpected updates. |
| `FLARESOLVERR_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:v3.3.21` | Track newer FlareSolverr releases when needed. |
| `CADDY_IMAGE` | `caddy:2.8.4` | Pin the reverse proxy to a tested version or upgrade deliberately. |

### Service hostnames
Caddy is the only container exposing ports on the LAN, terminating HTTP/HTTPS on 80/443 and proxying to each application by hostname. When `local_dns` is enabled, dnsmasq already resolves each `<service>.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` entry to `LAN_IP`; otherwise point your LAN DNS (or `/etc/hosts`) at the host manually.

| Service      | Hostname pattern | Internal port variable | Default port |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| qBittorrent  | `qbittorrent.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `QBT_HTTP_PORT_HOST` | `8080` |
| Sonarr       | `sonarr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `SONARR_PORT` | `8989` |
| Radarr       | `radarr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `RADARR_PORT` | `7878` |
| Prowlarr     | `prowlarr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `PROWLARR_PORT` | `9696` |
| Bazarr       | `bazarr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `BAZARR_PORT` | `6767` |
| FlareSolverr | `flaresolverr.${CADDY_DOMAIN_SUFFIX}` | `FLARESOLVERR_PORT` | `8191` |

If you reconfigure an application to listen on a different internal port, update the corresponding variable so Caddy continues routing correctly.

## Daily operations
The installer adds two aliases to `~/.bashrc` when possible:

```bash
arrstack       # rerun the installer from the repo
arrstack-logs  # follow Gluetun logs
source ${ARR_STACK_DIR:-/path/to/arrstack}/.arraliases  # load helper functions
```

The generated `.arraliases` file enables:

```bash
arr.help       # Show the full alias catalogue
arr.vpn.status # Inspect VPN status and forwarded port
arr.vpn.switch # Rotate Proton exit countries (or pick one explicitly)
arr.health     # Summarise container health checks
arr.open       # Print (or open) service URLs in your browser
```

The installer also drops `/gluetun/hooks/update-qbt-port.sh`, which Gluetun executes whenever Proton assigns a new port so qBittorrent's listen socket is updated immediately. The `port-sync` helper container keeps polling the control API as a fallback to catch any missed updates.

Manage the stack directly with Docker Compose commands from `${ARR_STACK_DIR}` if you prefer finer-grained control.

## Security posture
### Gluetun control API
The control server listens inside the VPN namespace and is published to the host at `${LOCALHOST_IP:-127.0.0.1}:${GLUETUN_CONTROL_PORT:-8000}`. It is forced to bind on IPv4 loopback to avoid `localhost` resolving to IPv6 and breaking the control client. API-key authentication is enforced via Gluetun's `HTTP_CONTROL_SERVER_AUTH=apikey` and `HTTP_CONTROL_SERVER_APIKEY=${GLUETUN_API_KEY}` environment variables. Legacy `/gluetun/auth/config.toml` files are removed automatically to avoid schema drift, so requests must include `X-API-Key: ${GLUETUN_API_KEY}` when calling the limited set of endpoints the stack uses (`/v1/publicip/ip`, `/v1/openvpn/status`, `/v1/forwardedport`, `/v1/openvpn/portforwarded`):

```bash
curl -fsS -H "X-API-Key: $GLUETUN_API_KEY" \
  "http://${LOCALHOST_IP:-127.0.0.1}:${GLUETUN_CONTROL_PORT:-8000}/v1/publicip/ip"

curl -fsS -H "X-API-Key: $GLUETUN_API_KEY" \
  "http://${LOCALHOST_IP:-127.0.0.1}:${GLUETUN_CONTROL_PORT:-8000}/v1/forwardedport"

# Fallback for older Gluetun releases that expose JSON only:
curl -fsS -H "X-API-Key: $GLUETUN_API_KEY" \
  "http://${LOCALHOST_IP:-127.0.0.1}:${GLUETUN_CONTROL_PORT:-8000}/v1/openvpn/portforwarded" | jq '.port'
```

### Firewall and namespace
- Gluetun exposes only the configured LAN service ports plus the control API on `${LOCALHOST_IP}`.
- Health probes and forwarded port sync execute over the control API using the generated key.
- Secrets are never echoed to stdout; the strict profile writes files with `0600` and directories with `0700`, while the collaborative profile keeps secrets at `0600` but allows non-secret files/dirs to land as `0640`/`0750`.

## Logging and diagnostics
- Re-run the installer with `--rotate-api-key` to regenerate credentials if needed.
- Use `docker logs gluetun` (or the `arrstack-logs` alias) to monitor VPN connectivity.
- `docker compose ps` from `${ARR_STACK_DIR}` surfaces container state and health checks.
- `docker logs port-sync --tail 50` shows the helper container polling Gluetun and pushing the forwarded port into qBittorrent.
- Run `${ARR_STACK_DIR}/diagnose-vpn.sh` from the stack root to execute the autogenerated diagnostics (checks Gluetun health, validates the forwarded port, and restarts the VPN container when required).

## Troubleshooting
Refer to [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for Proton port-forward validation, health check tips, and common fixes. If Docker reports `manifest unknown` for a LinuxServer image, run `${ARR_STACK_DIR}/scripts/fix-versions.sh` to back up `.env`, swap in safe fallbacks, and then re-run the installer.
